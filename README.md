Initally it was using a node js server to transfer the data to the frontend. But I got problems on the size
of the responses. Even if it only transfer a subrgaph with the nodes related to a HCP the response size can
get over the maximum allowed response size for the free subscription.

Some extra egnineering need to be done in order to optimize it. There are some potential solutions to that.
The data format can be compressed quite a lot, the graph can be streamed, group the graph nodes, limit
the levels of the graph so it will show the nodes up to some fixed distance, etc...

For the sake of demo I have rolled the data as a mock data inside the frontend files.
